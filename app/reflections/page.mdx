## Reflections (10/2024)

- For example: layouts that previously required many hack techniques can now be achieved simply by using `flex` and `grid`.
- For instance: the floating of the top header, which used to require various positioning techniques, can now be done with `sticky`.
- Another example: for interview questions and algorithm problems that we used to compile, now with the support of AI, we just need to input the questions and it can generate answers, and the quality of the answers is quite good.
- Sometimes I think it might be better to just wait for the progress of the times rather than racking our brains to come up with various unrewarding methods to achieve effects that look cool.
- I can only express my feelings in a few sentences: When you're in the right place at the right time, even a pig can fly. A speck of dust from the era can be a mountain on an individual's head. With the changes of the times and technological innovations, we ordinary people can only go with the flow.
